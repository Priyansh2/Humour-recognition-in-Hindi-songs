Is duniya mein sab chor chor
Is duniya mein sab chor chor
Koi paisa chor koi murgi chor
Aur koi dil ka chor
Is duniya mein sab chor chor
Is duniya mein sab chor chor

Koi chori kare khazaane ki
Koi aane ya do aane ki
Koi chori kare khazaane ki
Koi chori kare khazaane ki
Koi aane ya do aane ki
Koi chhota chor koi bada chor
Ye baitha chor wo khada chor
Is duniya men sab chor chor
Is duniya men sab chor chor
Koi paisa chor koi murgi chor
Aur koi dil ka chor
Is duniya mein sab chor chor
Is duniya mein sab chor chor

Koi daka daale raaton men
Koi kaate baaton baaton men
Koi daka daale raaton men
Koi daka daale raaton men
Koi kaate baaton baaton men
Koi gora chor koi kaala chor
Koi laat saab ka saalaa chor
Is duniya men sab chor chor
Is duniya men sab chor chor
Koi paisa chor koi murgi chor
Aur koi dil ka chor
Is duniya mein sab chor chor
Is duniya mein sab chor chor

Koi kisi ki nind churata hai
Koi kisi ki nind churata hai
Aur maze se khud so jaata hai
Meri nind churaane aayaa hai
Koi aisaa hi dilwaalaa chor
Is duniya mein sab chor chor
Is duniya mein sab chor chor
Koi paisa chor koi murgi chor
Aur koi dil ka chor
Is duniya mein sab chor chor
Is duniya mein sab chor chor.
