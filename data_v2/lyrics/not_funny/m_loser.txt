Haaton ki rekhaayein aise rulaaye
Kisi rabbar se mit na paaye
Life kuchh bhi deti nahi hai
Badale mein leti hi rahi hai

Duniya mein kahin dekha hi nahi
He such a loser

Friday the thirteenth manhus kehlaaye
Birthday pe isake woh bhi sharmaaye
Jeans hai aisa isaka mukaddar
Panautiyon ka hai yeh sikandar
Such a o such a
Duniya mein kahin dekha hi nahi
He such a loser

Billi kisi ka rasta jo kaate
Bad luck mein samajho bichhaaye kaante
Par yeh jo kaante rasta kisi ka
Woh jaake talawe billi ke chaante
Such a o such a
Saari duniya mein kahin dekha hi nahi
He such a loser
